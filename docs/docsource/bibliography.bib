    abstract = "Control tasks in various applications are posed as setpoint-stabilization problems, where a constant reference has to be stabilized. For systems where changing references are given, formulations for tracking of a time-dependent trajectory or for following a geometric path are more suitable. In other cases, no clear reference is given, but only optimal economic behavior is desired. We outline how these control goals can be captured and embedded in a model predictive control design and provide theoretic formulations. We compare trajectory tracking and path following in a realistic robot simulation example to highlight that it is important for an engineer to choose the appropriate formulation of the control task at hand.",

    abstract = {An algorithm for the numerical solution of parameterized optimal control problems is presented, which is based on multiple shooting in connection with a recursive quadratic progrmrming technique. A condensing algorithm for the solution of the approximating linearly constrained quadratic subproblems, and high rank update procedures are introduced, which are especially suited for optimal control problems and lead to significant improvements of the convergence behaviour and reductions of computing time and storage requirements. The algorithm is completely derivative-free due to internal numerical differentiation schemes, it can be conveniently combined with indirect multiple shooting. Numerical results are given in the field of aerospace engineering.}
